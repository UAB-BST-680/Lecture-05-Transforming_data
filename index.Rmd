**Characteristics of tidy data:**

1. Each variable is a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# Pipes

---

## Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**.

.pull-left[
![pipe](img/magritte.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](img/magrittr.jpg)
]

## Review: How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.

- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

- Writing it out using pipes gives a more natural structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

## What about other arguments?

To send results to a function argument other than first one or to use the previous result for multiple arguments, use `.`:

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
nhanes %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  lm(bp_sys_mmhg ~ age, data = .) #<<
```

## NHANES data

Pulled from [NHANES website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx), filtered to `r nrow(nhanes)` observations by you.


```{r}
glimpse(nhanes, width = 60)
```

## `dplyr`

---

`dplyr` is known as the grammar of data manipulation. 

Single data frame functions / verbs:

- `select`, `rename`: select / rename specific columns by name
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `transmute`: create new data frame with variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- ... (many more)

---

`dplyr` has rules: 

1. First argument is _always_ a data frame

2. Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

3. _Always_ return a data frame

4. Don't modify in place

5. Performance via lazy evaluation
