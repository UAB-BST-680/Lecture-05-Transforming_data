# Pipes

---

## Where does the name come from?

The pipe operator is implemented in the package **magrittr**.

.pull-left[
![pipe](img/magritte.jpg)
]
.pull-right[
![magrittr](img/magrittr.jpg)
]

---

## Review: How does a pipe work?

- You can think about the following sequence of actions - find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to school, park.

- Expressed as a set of nested functions in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "campus"))
```

- Writing it out using pipes gives a more natural structure:

```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "campus") %>%
  park()
```

---

## What about other arguments?

To send results to a function argument other than first one or to use the previous result for multiple arguments, use `.`:

```{r fig.height=1.8, fig.width = 3.75}
nhanes %>%
  filter(sex == "Female") %>%
  lm(bp_sys_mmhg ~ age, data = .) #<<
```

## NHANES data

Pulled from [NHANES website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx), filtered to `r nrow(nhanes)` observations by you.


```{r}
glimpse(nhanes, width = 60)
```

## Data wrangling

---

`dplyr` is known as the grammar of data manipulation. 

Single data frame functions / verbs:

- `select`, `rename`: select / rename specific columns by name
- `pull`: grab a column as a vector
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `slice`: pick rows using index(es)
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `transmute`: create new data frame with variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `count`: special case of `summarise` that computes frequencies.
- ... (many more)

---

`dplyr` has rules: 

1. First argument is _always_ a data frame

2. Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame

3. _Always_ return a data frame

4. Don't modify in place

5. Performance via lazy evaluation

---

Let's make some conditional variables!

- `albuminuria`: 

    + 'Yes' if ACR > 30 mg / g
    
    + 'No' otherwise.

- `bp_cat`:

    + 'Normotensive' if SBP < 130 and DBP < 80 mm Hg

    + 'Hypertension' if SBP is 130 to < 140 or DBP is 80 to < 90 mm Hg

    + 'Uncontrolled' if SBP is > 140 or DBP is > 90 mm Hg

---

`dplyr` provides two main functions for conditional execution:

- `if_else()` for variables with 2 categories

- `case_when()` for variables with >2 categories

---

- `albuminuria`: 

    + 'Yes' if ACR > 30 mg / g
    
    + 'No' otherwise.

```{r}

nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    albuminuria = if_else(
      condition = acr_mgg > 30,
      true = 'Yes', 
      false = 'No'
    )
  )

```

__Check your work!__

Make it a habit to check each data processing step you complete.

- Yes, this will slow you down in the short term

- Yes, it is very much worth it.

```{r}

nhanes %$% table(albuminuria, acr_mgg > 30)

# same thing as table(nhanes$albuminuria, nhanes$acr_mgg > 30)

```

---

- `bp_cat`:

    + 'Normotensive' if SBP < 130 and DBP < 80 mm Hg
    
    + 'Hypertension' if SBP is 130 to < 140 or DBP is 80 to < 90 mm Hg
    
    + 'Uncontrolled' if SBP is > 140 or DBP is > 90 mm Hg

```{r}

nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    bp_cat = case_when(
      bp_sys_mmhg  < 130 & bp_dia_mmhg  < 80 ~ "Normotensive",
      bp_sys_mmhg  < 140 & bp_dia_mmhg  < 90 ~ "Hypertension",
      bp_sys_mmhg >= 140 | bp_dia_mmhg >= 90 ~ "Uncontrolled",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_ # added for clarity
    )
  )

```

---

__Check your work!__


```{r}
ggplot(nhanes) + 
  aes(x = bp_sys_mmhg, y = bp_dia_mmhg, col = bp_cat) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

Use `summarize()` to, well, summarize your data

The values are summarised in a data frame

```{r}
nhanes %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sbp = mean(bp_sys_mmhg),
    mean_dbp = mean(bp_dia_mmhg),
    prevalence_alb = mean(albuminuria == 'Yes', na.rm = TRUE)
  )
  
```

---

`group_by() %>% summarize()` summarizes each group:


```{r}
nhanes %>%
  group_by(exam) %>% 
  summarise(mean_sbp = mean(bp_sys_mmhg),
    prevalence_alb = mean(albuminuria == 'Yes', na.rm = TRUE))
  
```

## Factors

---

- factors are used to work with categorical variables

- categorical variables have a fixed and known set of finite values. 


```{r}

fctr <- factor(
  x = c(1, 2, 2, 3),
  levels = c(1,2,3),
  labels = c("A", "B", "C")
)

fctr

```

---

Sometimes factors make you say, "I don't know about that"

.pull-left[
```{r}

x1 <- factor(c(1,2), 
  labels = c('a','b'))

x2 <- factor(3, labels = 'c')


c(x1, x2)

```
]

--

.pull-right[


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

knitr::include_graphics('img/chappelle_skeptic.png')

```
]

- `forcats` makes factors easier to wrangle

```{r}
forcats::fct_c(x1, x2)
```

---

Convert character/numeric vectors to factors if 

- you want to impose an ordering that is not alphabetical.

```{r}

count(nhanes, bp_cat)

```

---

Convert character/numeric vectors to factors if 

- you want to impose an ordering that is not alphabetical.

```{r}

nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    bp_cat = factor(
      x = bp_cat, 
      levels = c('Normotensive', 'Hypertension', 'Uncontrolled')
    )
  )

count(nhanes, bp_cat)

```

---

Convert character/numeric vectors to factors if 

- you have a numeric variable that should be a categorical one

```{r}

count(nhanes, bp_high_aware)

```

---

Convert character/numeric vectors to factors if 

- you have a numeric variable that should be a categorical one

```{r}

nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    bp_high_aware = factor(
      x = bp_high_aware, 
      levels = c(0, 1),
      labels = c("No", "Yes")
    )
  )

count(nhanes, bp_high_aware)

```

---

Relevel factors (change their order) with `forcats`: 

```{r}

library(forcats)

nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    bp_cat = fct_relevel(
      bp_cat, 'Uncontrolled', 'Hypertension'
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(bp_cat)

```

---

Collapse factors (lump categories) with `forcats`: 

```{r}

nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    bp_cat = fct_collapse(
      bp_cat, 
      "Hypertensive" = c("Hypertension", "Uncontrolled")
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(bp_cat)

```

---

Explicitly set factor missing levels to their own category

```{r}

count(nhanes, education)

```

---

Explicitly set factor missing levels to their own category

```{r}

nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    education = fct_explicit_na(
      f = education,
      na_level = 'Missing' 
    )
  )

count(nhanes, education)

```

---

Recode factor levels manually:

```{r}

nhanes %>% 
  mutate(
    education = fct_recode(
      education,
      # new level = old level
      'less_than_hs' = 'Less than high school',
      'hs_some_college' = 'High school/some college',
      'college_grad' = 'College graduate'        
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(education)

```
